Hide unwanted jobs from one of the most popular job search engines in Austria

Make your favorite job searching portal even better!

Sometimes it is annoying to see the same unsuitable jobs every time you press the "Jobs finden" button. 
With this extension you can mark such jobs you don't want to see in the future, so they'll appear in the search results grayed and with fewer details.

All the results are still visible. You can switch the job back to a normal state whenever you want.

Feedback is appreciated.

The extension doesn't collect and doesn't transfer any data. However, if you log in into your browser, it can synchronize a list of hidden jobs between different devices with your accounts on its own.

Thanks https://openmoji.org/ for an icon I used in this extension.
